# Project Rules: AI Agent Release Readiness QA

## Project Intent
This repository implements a deterministic QA-based release readiness assessment
for AI agent and LLM-based systems.

The goal is NOT to:
- build an AI automation framework
- judge model answers using another LLM
- replace testing with AI

The goal IS to:
- extract signals from existing test runs and artifacts
- assess behavioral stability and regression risk
- provide a clear release readiness score and recommendation

## Core Principles
- Deterministic logic first. No LLM-based judging unless explicitly requested.
- No new test creation. Only analyze what already exists.
- Prefer explainable metrics over "smart" heuristics.
- Every score must be traceable to concrete evidence.
- Reports must be understandable by QA, PMs, and technical leadership.

## Architecture Rules
- Core readiness logic must be reusable and isolated.
- Pack-specific logic (AI/LLM interpretation) must live in a separate layer.
- Input data formats must be explicit and validated.
- Optional AI artifacts (conversation logs, intents) must degrade gracefully.

## Implementation Rules
- Propose a plan before implementing multi-file changes.
- Keep commits small and logically isolated.
- Add tests for scoring, parsing, and risk classification.
- Prefer simple Python structures over complex abstractions.

## Reporting Rules
- Reports must include:
  - readiness score (0–100)
  - risk level (low / medium / high)
  - key behavioral risks
  - release recommendation
- Always state data availability and assumptions explicitly.

## Tone & Language
- Professional QA / engineering tone.
- No marketing language in code or reports.
- Clear, concise, factual wording.
